### Key Features

- **Dual-Platform Support**: Console-based Node.js application and browser-based web interface
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with adaptive layouts for all screen sizes
- **Automated Testing**: Jest test suite with 100% coverage of core game logic
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing and deployment via GitHub Actions
- **Modern UI/UX**: Smooth animations, real-time balance tracking, and intuitive controls
- **Professional Architecture**: Modular code structure with clear separation of concerns

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

### Frontend
- **HTML5**: Semantic markup with accessible structure
- **CSS3**: Custom animations, CSS Grid/Flexbox layouts, CSS variables for theming
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: ES6+ features, DOM manipulation, event-driven architecture

### Backend/CLI
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment for command-line version
- **npm**: Package management and dependency resolution

### Testing & Quality Assurance
- **Jest**: Unit testing framework with comprehensive test coverage
- **ESLint**: Code quality and consistency (configurable)

### DevOps
- **Git**: Version control with branching strategies
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD automation for testing and deployment
- **GitHub Pages**: Static site hosting with automatic deployments

## 🎮 How to Play

### Web Version
1. Visit the [live application](https://juneshg.github.io/Slot-Machine/)
2. Deposit funds to start playing
3. Select number of betting lines (1-3)
4. Set your bet amount per line
5. Click "SPIN" to play
6. Win when matching symbols appear on active paylines

### Command-Line Version
```bash
node project.js
```

## 💻 Local Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14.0.0 or higher)
- npm (v6.0.0 or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JuneshG/Slot-Machine.git
cd Slot-Machine
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Run tests:
```bash
npm test
```

4. Start the CLI version:
```bash
node project.js
```

5. Open the web version:
```bash
# Simply open index.html in your browser
# Or use a local server:
npx serve .
```

## 🧪 Testing

The project includes a comprehensive Jest test suite covering all core game mechanics:

- **Spin Function Tests**: Validates reel generation and symbol distribution
- **Transpose Function Tests**: Ensures correct matrix transformation
- **Winning Calculation Tests**: Verifies payout logic accuracy
- **Edge Case Handling**: Tests boundary conditions and error states

Run the test suite:
```bash
npm test
```

View test coverage:
```bash
npm test -- --coverage
```

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

The project uses GitHub Actions for automated quality assurance:

1. **Continuous Integration**: Automatically runs Jest tests on every push
2. **Deployment Gate**: Only deploys if all tests pass
3. **Continuous Deployment**: Automatically publishes to GitHub Pages
4. **Build Verification**: Ensures production build integrity
